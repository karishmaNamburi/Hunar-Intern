### **Data Cleaning Summary**

In this task, we performed essential data preprocessing steps using Python and the Pandas library. The primary objective was to clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicate records, and eliminating duplicate columns. Below is a summary of the steps undertaken:

#### **1. Handling Missing Values**

We addressed missing values in the dataset using three common statistical techniques:

* **Mean Imputation**: For numeric columns, we created new columns where missing values were replaced with the column’s mean.
* **Median Imputation**: Another version of the data was created by filling missing numeric values with the column’s median.
* **Mode Imputation**: Missing values (both numeric and categorical) were filled with the most frequent value (mode) of each column.

This approach allows for flexibility in choosing the most suitable imputation method based on the context or nature of the data.

#### **2. Removing Duplicate Rows**

We identified and removed any duplicate rows from the dataset using `pandas.DataFrame.drop_duplicates()`. This ensures that each observation in the dataset is unique and avoids redundancy.

#### **3. Removing Duplicate Columns**

To remove duplicate columns (i.e., columns with exactly the same values), we transposed the DataFrame, used the `drop_duplicates()` function, and transposed it back. This step helps in reducing multicollinearity and improving data quality.


These cleaning steps are critical for preparing the data for further analysis or modeling, ensuring accuracy, consistency, and reliability in the results.
